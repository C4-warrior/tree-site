As autumn arrives, we start to see trees shift from shades of green to rich golds and ambers. It’s a wonderful time of year, even though it eventually leads to bare branches and a carpet of leaves below that often requires plenty of cleanup.

In my area of West Yorkshire, I’ve noticed that horse chestnuts (conker trees) make this transition earlier than many others.

The reason is the horse chestnut leaf miner — the larvae of a small moth that bores into the leaves, creating white and brown blotchy “mines.” These mines destroy the leaf tissue, causing the leaves to fall early. While this usually won’t kill a healthy tree, repeated infestations can weaken it, leaving it more vulnerable to other problems, such as the more serious horse chestnut bleeding canker.

Because the leaf miner isn’t considered a major threat to overall tree health, a gentler approach to control is best. The most effective method is to rake and remove fallen horse chestnut leaves in autumn and winter. If the leaves are disposed of properly — either by burning or sealed composting — the overwintering pupae are destroyed, which helps reduce the scale of the next year’s infestation.
