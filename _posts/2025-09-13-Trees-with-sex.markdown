I was out in Munich, Germany, having a wander around when my eye was drawn to the street trees. There were lots of ash, sycamore, poplar, and London plane—species I’d seen plenty of times before in the UK. Then I came across a tree I didn’t recognize.

They were tall, over 15 meters, with rough, dull grey-brown bark—similar in many ways to a poplar, except for their extremely distinctive leaves. The leaves were fan-shaped with two lobes, something I hadn’t seen before.

After doing a bit of research, I discovered they were ginkgo trees—a hardy species from East Asia. They’re often chosen for their resilience to air pollution, ability to grow in almost any soil condition, and impressive longevity (up to 100 years). Ginkgos are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. The trees lining the streets were male, since the females produce edible but very smelly fruit.

Just something I found curious on my walk.
