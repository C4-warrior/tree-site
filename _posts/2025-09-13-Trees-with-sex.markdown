I was out in Munich, Germany, having a wander around when my eye turned to the street trees. There were plenty of ash, sycamore, poplar, and London plane — species I’d seen many times before in the UK. Then I came across some trees I didn’t recognize.

They were tall (15m+), with rough, dull grey-brown bark, in many ways similar to a poplar — except for their extremely distinctive leaves. The leaves were fan-shaped with two lobes, something I had never seen before.

After doing some research, I discovered these were ginkgo trees, a hardy species from East Asia. They are chosen for their resilience to air pollution, their ability to grow in almost any soil conditions, and their longevity (up to 1,000 years!). Ginkgos are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. The ones planted along the streets were male, since female trees produce edible but very smelly fruit.

In dioecious trees, the male plants produce pollen but no fruit, while the female flowers bear seeds or fruit. This system promotes higher genetic diversity through cross-pollination. A few English species of dioecious trees you might recognize are holly, yew, aspen, willow, and some species of ash.

Another reproductive strategy in trees is monoecy. Monoecious trees have both male and female flowers on the same plant, meaning they can self-pollinate or cross-pollinate. Generally, this results in lower genetic diversity, especially if self-pollinating. All mature, healthy monoecious trees are capable of producing seeds. Some common native monoecious trees in England are hazel, English oak, beech, alder, silver birch, and hornbeam.

Just something I found curious while tree-spotting in Munich!
